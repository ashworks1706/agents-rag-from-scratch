# deep-rag-from-scratch

I wanted to learn AI Agents, agentic workflows and the retreival augmented generation space from the very core level to advanced State-Of-The-Art level, which is why i created this notebook as in the form my notes, though i can't cover all the concepts, I do go thoroughly into background theory and math behind those concepts as well as code implementation.

Hopefully this is helpful to you guys, Thanks!
