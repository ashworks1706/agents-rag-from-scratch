    "The concept of intelligent agents has evolved dramatically over the past seven decades, transforming from simple rule-based systems to today's sophisticated AI companions that can reason, plan, and act autonomously. Understanding this progression is essential because it helps us appreciate why modern agentic systems represent such a significant breakthrough and why they're becoming central to how we build AI applications. The journey began in the 1950s when researchers like Allen Newell and Herbert Simon created the Logic Theorist, a program that could prove mathematical theorems by exploring different logical paths. These early agents were like skilled craftsmen—they could perform specific tasks very well, but only within narrow, pre-defined domains. The 1970s and 1980s brought expert systems like MYCIN for medical diagnosis and DENDRAL for chemical analysis. While impressive, these systems required months of manual knowledge engineering, where human experts had to explicitly encode their domain knowledge into rigid rule sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1990s marked a shift toward more flexible software agents that could operate in networked environments and coordinate with other agents. This period introduced the concept of multi-agent systems, where multiple specialized agents could collaborate to solve complex problems. However, these systems still required extensive manual programming and could only handle situations their creators had anticipated. The real transformation began in the 2000s with machine learning advances. Agents could now learn from data rather than relying solely on hand-coded rules. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa brought agent technology to mainstream consumers, though they remained relatively narrow in scope—essentially sophisticated voice interfaces for search and simple task execution.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/1*Ygen57Qiyrc8DXAFsjZLNA.gif\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakthrough moment arrived with large language models starting around 2020. Systems like GPT-3 and GPT-4 combined vast knowledge with sophisticated reasoning abilities, creating agents that could understand natural language, maintain context across conversations, and tackle a wide variety of tasks without task-specific programming. Unlike their predecessors, these modern agents can break down complex problems into steps, use external tools when needed, and adapt to new situations they've never encountered before. This evolution represents a fundamental shift from automation to augmentation. Where early agents automated specific, predefined tasks, today's agents can understand our goals and work as collaborative partners in problem-solving. They can handle ambiguous instructions, incomplete information, and constantly changing contexts—capabilities that make them invaluable for building sophisticated applications like retrieval-augmented generation systems."

    "When we talk about agents in 2025, we're entering a landscape where the term has become both ubiquitous and somewhat ambiguous. Different organizations and researchers use \"agent\" to describe everything from simple chatbots to fully autonomous systems that can operate independently for weeks. This diversity in definition isn't just academic—it reflects fundamentally different architectural approaches that will determine how we build the next generation of AI applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "At its core, an agent is a system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. However, the way these capabilities are implemented varies dramatically. Some define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools and adapting their strategies based on feedback. Think of these like a personal assistant who can manage your entire schedule, book flights, handle emails, and make decisions on your behalf without constant supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others use the term more broadly to describe any system that follows predefined workflows to accomplish tasks. These implementations are more like following a detailed recipe—each step is predetermined, and while the system can handle some variations, it operates within clearly defined boundaries. The distinction between these approaches is crucial because it affects everything from system reliability to development complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful way to think about this spectrum is through the lens of control and decision-making. Workflows are systems where large language models and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Every decision point is anticipated by the developer, and the system follows predetermined logic to handle different scenarios. Agents, in contrast, are systems where the LLM dynamically directs its own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how it accomplishes tasks. The model itself decides what to do next, which tools to use, and how to adapt when things don't go as planned.\n",

    "When building applications with LLMs, the fundamental principle should be finding the simplest solution that meets your requirements. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems inherently trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you need to carefully consider when this tradeoff makes sense for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks where you can anticipate most scenarios and edge cases. They're excellent for standardized processes like data processing pipelines, content moderation, or structured analysis tasks. Agents become the better choice when you need flexibility and model-driven decision-making at scale—situations where the variety of inputs and required responses is too broad to predefine, or where the system needs to adapt to entirely new scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality is that for many applications, the most effective approach involves optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples rather than building complex agentic systems. However, as we'll explore throughout this tutorial, there are compelling scenarios where the additional complexity of agents becomes not just beneficial, but necessary for achieving your goals. Understanding when and how to make this transition is what separates effective AI system builders from those who over-engineer solutions to problems that could be solved more simply.\n",

    "\n",
    "Think of prompts as the instruction manual for your AI agent—just as a well-written manual can make the difference between a novice successfully assembling furniture or ending up with a pile of confused parts, a well-crafted prompt determines whether your agent performs brilliantly or struggles to understand your intent. The quality and structure of your prompts directly influence the agent's reasoning capabilities, tool usage patterns, and overall effectiveness in completing tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several types of prompts that serve different purposes in agentic systems. System prompts establish the agent's role, personality, and fundamental operating principles—these are like giving someone their job description and company handbook before they start work. User prompts contain the specific tasks or questions you want the agent to handle, while few-shot prompts provide examples of desired input-output patterns to guide the agent's responses. Chain-of-thought prompts encourage step-by-step reasoning, helping agents break down complex problems into manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-step agentic workflows, prompt engineering becomes particularly sophisticated because you need to design prompts that not only solve individual tasks but also coordinate between different stages of processing. The agent needs to understand when to use specific tools, how to interpret tool outputs, and how to maintain context across multiple interaction cycles. This requires careful consideration of prompt structure, token efficiency, and the logical flow of information through your system.\n",

    "The examples above demonstrate how hyperparameters create a fundamental tradeoff between instruction following and creative knowledge application. Low temperature models excel at following precise formatting requirements and maintaining consistency across multiple calls, making them ideal for structured data extraction, API responses, and workflows where predictability is paramount. Higher temperature models bring more of the model's training knowledge into play, generating more diverse responses and creative solutions, but at the cost of strict instruction adherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This balance becomes critical in agentic systems where you need to decide whether your agent should be a precise executor of specific instructions or a creative problem-solver that can adapt its approach based on context. The choice often depends on your use case: customer service bots might need low-temperature consistency, while creative writing assistants might benefit from higher-temperature diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to control our model's behavior through prompts and hyperparameters, we need to give our agents the ability to extend beyond their base knowledge and interact with the world. This is where tools come into play - they're what transform a language model from a sophisticated text generator into an active agent that can perform real actions and access current information."

    "Tools are what transform language models from sophisticated text generators into active agents capable of performing real-world actions and accessing live information. Think of tools as the hands and senses of your AI agent - without them, even the most advanced language model is limited to working with only the knowledge it was trained on, which becomes stale the moment training ends. Tools bridge this gap by allowing agents to interact with databases, APIs, web services, file systems, and any other external systems your application needs to work with.\n",

    "The fundamental concept behind tools in agentic systems is function calling (also known as tool calling). Modern language models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini have been specifically trained to understand when they need external information or capabilities, and can generate structured function calls with appropriate parameters. When an agent encounters a question about current weather, stock prices, or needs to perform calculations, it doesn't hallucinate an answer - instead, it recognizes the limitation and calls the appropriate tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool execution process follows a predictable pattern: the agent receives a user request, analyzes what information or actions are needed, determines which tools to use, formats the tool calls with proper parameters, executes the tools, receives the results, and then synthesizes a response using both its knowledge and the tool outputs. This creates a powerful feedback loop where agents can chain multiple tool calls together, use the output of one tool as input to another, and dynamically adapt their approach based on intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main categories of tools we'll explore: **built-in tools** that come pre-integrated with language model providers, **explicit tools** that you define and implement yourself, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools** that provide standardized interfaces for complex integrations. Each category serves different purposes and offers varying levels of customization and complexity."

Google's Gemini models, for example, come with several powerful built-in tools including Google Search integration, code execution capabilities, and mathematical computation tools.

Similarly, the code execution tool allows Gemini to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment, making it excellent for data analysis, mathematical calculations, and generating visualizations.\n",

    "Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents the next evolution in AI tool integration, providing a standardized way for AI applications to securely connect to data sources and tools. Think of MCP as a universal translator that allows any AI system to communicate with any external service through a common protocol, eliminating the need for custom integrations for each tool or data source.\n",

    "\n",
    "MCP was developed by Anthropic to solve the fragmentation problem in AI tool ecosystems. Before MCP, every AI application had to implement its own custom integrations for databases, APIs, file systems, and other external resources. This led to duplicated effort, security inconsistencies, and tools that only worked with specific AI platforms. MCP standardizes these interactions through a client-server architecture where MCP servers expose resources (like databases or file systems) and tools (like calculators or API clients) through a uniform interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol operates on JSON-RPC 2.0, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between AI applications (MCP clients) and external resources (MCP servers). This means your agent can not only call tools but also receive real-time updates, notifications, and streaming data from external systems. The security model is built around explicit capability declarations and sandboxed execution, ensuring that agents can only access resources they've been explicitly granted permission to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes MCP particularly powerful for RAG and agentic systems is its ability to provide **contextual data access**. Instead of just calling functions, MCP servers can expose rich contextual information about resources - like database schemas, file structures, or API capabilities - allowing agents to make more informed decisions about how to interact with external systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we design agentic systems, the choice between different tool types depends on your specific requirements:\n",
    "- Use **built-in tools** when the model provider offers functionality that meets your needs\n",
    "- Create **explicit tools** when you need custom integration with your specific systems  \n",
    "- Implement **MCP tools** when you need standardized, scalable integrations across multiple AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our agents can take actions in the world through tools, we need to ensure they can maintain context and remember information across interactions. This is where memory and context management become crucial for building agents that can handle complex, multi-step workflows and maintain coherent conversations over time."

    "Context management is the cognitive backbone of sophisticated agents, determining how they maintain awareness of ongoing conversations, remember past interactions, and build upon previous knowledge to provide coherent, contextually relevant responses. Without proper context management, even the most capable agents become like individuals with severe short-term memory loss—they might excel at individual tasks but fail to maintain meaningful, coherent interactions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of context management as the difference between having a conversation with a knowledgeable expert who remembers your entire discussion versus repeatedly starting fresh with someone who has no recollection of what you've already covered. The former builds understanding progressively, references earlier points, and adapts their communication based on your evolving needs. The latter, while potentially knowledgeable, forces you to repeat yourself and cannot build on the conversational foundation you've established.\n",
    "\n",
    "In agentic systems, context management becomes even more critical because agents need to coordinate information across multiple tool calls, maintain state during complex workflows, and remember important details that influence future decisions. An agent helping with financial planning needs to remember your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and previous decisions to provide consistent advice. A customer service agent should recall your account history, previous issues, and preferences to deliver personalized support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in balancing several competing factors: **memory capacity** (how much information can be retained), **relevance** (what information is most important to keep), **efficiency** (managing token limits and processing costs), and **persistence** (maintaining memory across sessions). Different memory strategies excel in different scenarios, and the best approach often involves combining multiple memory types to create a comprehensive context management system."

    "ConversationTokenBufferMemory provides the most sophisticated approach to memory management by dynamically adjusting conversation history based on token consumption rather than fixed message counts or arbitrary summarization triggers. This memory type continuously monitors token usage and intelligently removes older messages when approaching the specified token limit, ensuring optimal utilization of the model's context window while maintaining as much relevant history as possible.\n",

    "The key innovation here is token-aware pruning—the memory system counts tokens in the conversation history and removes the oldest messages when the total approaches the configured limit. This ensures you never exceed context limits while maximizing the amount of conversation history available to the model. It's like having an intelligent editor who knows exactly how much content fits in the available space and makes informed decisions about what to keep.\n",
